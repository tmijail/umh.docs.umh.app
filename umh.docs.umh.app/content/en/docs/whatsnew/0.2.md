## 0.2.0

### Management Console

- The Data Connections and Data Sources administration has been revised, and now
  it's all in one place called Connection Management. This new concept revolves
  around the idea of a connection, which is just a link between your UMH instance
  and a data source. You can then configure the connection to fetch data from the
  source, and monitor its status. Additionally, you can now edit existing connections
  and data source configurations, and delete them if you don't need them anymore.

## 0.2.2

### Management Console

- The updating functionality has been temporarily disabled, as it gives errors
  even when the update is successful. We are working on a fix for this issue and
  will re-enable the functionality as soon as possible.

## 0.2.3

Centralized all initial installation and continuous updating processes (Docker, k3s, helm, flatcar, â€¦) to interact solely with [management.umh.app](http://management.umh.app/). This ensures that only one domain is necessary to be allowed in the firewall for these activities.

### Data Infrastructure

- Upgraded the Helm Chart to version 0.10.6, which includes:
  - Transitioned Docker URLs to our internal registry from a single domain (see above)
  - Removed obsolete services: factoryinput, grafanaproxy, custom microservice tester, kafka-state-detector, mqtt-bridge. This change is also reflected in our documentation.
  - Resolved an issue where restarting kafka-to-postgres was necessary when adding a new topic.

### Device & Container Infrastructure

- Modified flatcar provisioning and the installation script to retrieve all necessary binaries from a single domain (see above)

### Management Console

- Addressed a bug that prevented the workspace tab from functioning correctly in the absence of configured connections.

## 0.2.4

### Management Console

- Addressed multiple bugs in the updater functionality, preventing the frontend from registering a completed update.

## 0.2.5

### Management Console

- Addressed multiple bugs in the updater functionality, preventing the frontend from registering a completed update.

## 0.2.6

### Management Console

  - Fixed crash on connection loss.
  - Structures for the new data model are now in place.

## 0.2.7

### Management Console

- Added companion functionality to generate and send v2 formatted tags.
- Added frontend functionality to retrieve v2 formatted tags.

## 0.2.8

### Management Console

- Re-enabled the updating functionality, which is now working as expected. You will need to manually update
  your instances' Management Companion to the latest version to ensure compatibility.
  To do so, from you UMH instance, run the following command:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) set image statefulset mgmtcompanion mgmtcompanion=management.umh.app/oci/united-manufacturing-hub/mgmtcompanion:0.2.8 -n mgmtcompanion --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```
