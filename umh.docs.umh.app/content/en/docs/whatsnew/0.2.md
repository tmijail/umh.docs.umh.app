## 0.2.0

### Management Console

- The Data Connections and Data Sources administration has been revised, and now
  it's all in one place called Connection Management. This new concept revolves
  around the idea of a connection, which is just a link between your UMH instance
  and a data source. You can then configure the connection to fetch data from the
  source, and monitor its status. Additionally, you can now edit existing connections
  and data source configurations, and delete them if you don't need them anymore.
- It is now possible to upgrade the Management Companion directly from the Management
  Console. You will first need to
  [manually upgrade](/docs/production-guide/upgrading/upgrading/#i-installed-the-management-companion-before-the-020-release-how-do-i-upgrade-it)
  it to this version, and then for all the future versions you will be able to do
  it [directly from the Management Console](/docs/features/devicecontainerinfrastructure/upgrading/).
