## RedPanda

[RedPanda](https://redpanda.com/) is a Kafka-compatible event streaming
platform. It is built with modern hardware in mind and utilizes multi-core CPUs
efficiently, which can result in better performance compared to Kafka. RedPanda
also offers lower latency and higher throughput, making it a better fit for
real-time use cases in IIoT applications. Additionally, RedPanda has a simpler
setup and management process compared to Kafka, which can save time and
resources for development teams. Finally, RedPanda is fully compatible with
Kafka's API, allowing for a seamless transition for existing Kafka users.

Overall, Redpanda can provide improved performance and efficiency for IIoT
applications that require real-time data processing and management with a lower
setup and management cost.
