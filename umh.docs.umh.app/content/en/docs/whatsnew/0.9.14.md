<!-- overview -->

Welcome to United Manufacturing Hub version 0.9.14! In this release we changed
the Kafka broker from Apache Kafka to RedPanda, which is a Kafka-compatible
event streaming platform. We also started migrating to a different kafka
library in our micoservices, which will allow full ARM support in the future.
<!-- insert a one-liner about the release here -->

For a complete list of changes, refer to the
[release notes](https://github.com/united-manufacturing-hub/united-manufacturing-hub/releases/tag/v0.9.14/).

## RedPanda

[RedPanda](https://redpanda.com/) is a Kafka-compatible event streaming
platform. It is built with modern hardware in mind and utilizes multi-core CPUs
efficiently, which can result in better performance compared to Kafka. RedPanda
also offers lower latency and higher throughput, making it a better fit for
real-time use cases in IIoT applications. Additionally, RedPanda has a simpler
setup and management process compared to Kafka, which can save time and
resources for development teams. Finally, RedPanda is fully compatible with
Kafka's API, allowing for a seamless transition for existing Kafka users.

Overall, Redpanda can provide improved performance and efficiency for IIoT
applications that require real-time data processing and management with a lower
setup and management cost.

## Sarama Kafka Library

We started migrating our microservices to use the
[Sarama](https://github.com/Shopify/sarama) Kafka library. This library is
written in Go and is fully compatible with RedPanda. This change will allow us
to support ARM-based devices in the future, which will be useful for edge
computing use cases. Addedd bonus is that Sarama is faster and requires less
memory than the previous library.

## Resources tweaking

With this release we tweaked the resource requests of each default component
of the United Manufacturing Hub to respect the minimum requirements of 4 cores
and 8GB of RAM. This allowed us to increase the memory allocated for the MQTT
broker, resulting in solving the common Out Of Memory issue that caused the
broker to restart.

Be sure to follow the [upgrade guide](/docs/production-guide/upgrading/0.9.14/)
to adjust your resources accordingly.

## Container registry

We moved our container registry from Docker Hub to GitHub Container Registry.
This change won't affect the way you deploy the United Manufacturing Hub, but
it will allow us to better manage our container images and provide a better
experience for our developers. For the time being, we will continue to publish
our images to Docker Hub, but we will eventually deprecate this method.
