  The United Manufacturing Hub provides several simulators, which deliver
  different data through various protocols such as MQTT, PackML or OPC UA. In
  this chapter we will take the MQTT simulated data and show you how to format
  it into the **[UMH data model](/docs/architecture/datamodel/)** using Node-RED. 
  It is highly recommended to read through the documentation of the UMH data
  model before continuing with this chapter.

## Creating Node-RED flow with simulated MQTT-Data

1. Access the Node-RED web interface through your local installation's device
   overview by selecting the **open** button on the Node-RED popup. You can
   access popups by clicking on the corresponding microservice tile.

2. To access the simulated raw data via MQTT, you need to add an MQTT broker.
   From the left-hand column, drag an **mqtt-in** node, an **mqtt-out** node, and
   a **debug** node into your flow and connect the **mqtt-in** and to the
   **debug** node.

3. Double-click on the **mqtt-in** node and click
   on the **pencil button** on the right  of the **Server** field. Use the 
  service name **united-manufacturing-hub-mqtt** as **Server** (or the name 
  located in the Management Console **Useful Information**-tab). Leave the
   port as autoconfigured and click on **Add** to save your changes.

4. To view all incoming messages from a specific topic, type `ia/#` under 
   **Topic** and click on **Done**.

  {{% notice info %}}
In brokers like MQTT or Kafka, data is structured hierarchically in **topics**.
These topics categorize data into specific groups for efficient management.
If you subscribe to a topic, you receive every message that is published to it.
In the UMH data-model, the topics are defined in this format:

- **MQTT:** `ia/<customerID>/<location>/<AssetID>/<message>`
- **Kafka:** `ia.<customerID>.<location>.<AssetID>.<message>`

`customerID` represents the enterprise, `location` signifies the
factory from which the data originates, `AssetID` denotes the specific machine
generating the data, and the final segment `message` is the name of the
message or data.

5. To apply the changes, click on **Deploy** located at the top right of the 
   screen. Once the changes have been deployed, you can view the debug 
   information by clicking on **Debug-Messages** located under **Deploy**. 

   ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManDebugDeploy.png)

  {{% notice info %}}
  Messages sent to the `raw` topic are not stored in the UMH database and are
  not processed by the UMH stack. You can use them to build your own data
  processing pipelines like in this example. For additional information, 
  refer to the
  [data-model documentation](https://umh.docs.umh.app/docs/architecture/datamodel/#raw-data)
  {{% /notice %}}

6. In this column, you can view all incoming messages and their respective
   topics. The incoming topics follow this format:
   `ia/raw/development/ioTSensors/`. To keep it simple, this tutorial will be
   only using the temperature topic, but feel free to choose any
   topic you'd like. Copy the temperature topic
   `ia/raw/development/ioTSensors/Temperature`, open the **mqtt-in** node,
   paste the copied topic in the **Topic** field, click on **Done**, and then
   press **Deploy** again to apply the changes.

   ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManNewTopic.png)

7. To format the incoming message according to the UMH data-model, add a
   **function** node, an **mqtt-out** and an **mqtt-in** to your flow. 
   Connect the nodes in the following order:
   **mqtt-in → function → mqtt-out** and the second flow: **mqtt-in → debug**.

   ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManNewNodes.png)

{{% notice info %}}
Incoming messages are not following the UMH data-model. To contextualize and
format them correctly, you can use the different message types. This is needed,
to ensure that the data is correctly processed by the UMH stack and other 
consumers.

In the documentation, you can find the complete
[list](https://umh.docs.umh.app/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/)
of all available message types and the respective topics.

8. Open the **function** node and paste in the following:

   ```jsx
   msg.payload = {
    
       "timestamp_ms": Date.now(), 
       "temperature": msg.payload
   }
   
   return msg;
   ```
   Now click on **Done**, open the **mqtt-out** node and paste 
   `ia/factoryinsight/Aachen/testing/processValue`
   in the **Topic** field and click on **Done**. To apply the changes, click 
   on **Deploy**. Now the message is correctly formatted into the data-model,
   specifically into a
   [processValue](https://umh.docs.umh.app/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/processvalue/)
   message. 


  {{% notice info %}}
  We are creating a new object, an array, with two keys `timestamp_ms` and
  `temperature` and their corresponding values `Date.now()` and 
  `msg.payload`. The last value, `msg.payload`, is referring to the **incoming**
  message. Since it is only carrying a single value, one does not need to 
  further specify it. 
  
  We also created a new topic in the **mqtt-out** node, where the messages 
  will be sent to. The topic ends with the key **processValue** which is used
  whenever a custom process value with unique name has been prepared. The
  value is numerical. You can learn more about our message 
  structure [here](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/).
  {{% /notice %}}

9. Open the second **mqtt-in** node, connected to the **debug** node, and set
   the topic to `ia/factoryinsight/Aachen/testing/processValue`, to receive all 
   the new messages. Make sure to select the created broker. Click on **Deploy** 
   to save the changes. The flows should now look like this:

![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManNodeCompl.png)

10. You should now see the converted message under **Debug-messages**. To clear
   any previous messages, click on the **trash bin** icon.
    ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManDebugWindow.png)

11. Congratulations, you have successfully converted the incoming message and
   exported it via MQTT. However, since we are currently only exporting the 
   temperature without actually working with the data, let's create a function
   that counts the critical temperature exceedances.

12. Drag another **function-node** into your page, open it and navigate to
   **On Start**.

![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManOnStartNew.png)


13. Paste in the following code, which will only run on start:

    ```jsx
    flow.set("count", 0);
    flow.set("current", 0)
    ```

14. Then click on **On-Message** and paste in the following and click **done**:

    ```jsx
    flow.set("current",msg.payload);
    
    if (flow.get("current") > 47) {
        flow.set("count", flow.get("count") + 1);
    
        msg.payload = {
            "timestamp_ms":Date.now(),
            "TemperatureWarning":flow.get("count")
        }
        return msg;
    }
    ```

    The pasted in code will work for each new message as shown in the diagram below.
    ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManTemperatureWarning.png)

15. Finally, connect the function-node like shown below and click on **deploy**.
    ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManNewFunction2.png)

16. If the incoming value of temperature is now greater than 47, you will see
   another message consisting of **TemperatureWarning** and a **timestamp** in 
   debug-messages.

## What's next?

  Continue with the tutorial in the Management Console. The next chapter will
  be about the use of Grafana to [display the formatted data](https://umh.docs.umh.app/docs/getstarted/datavisualization/) to proceed.
