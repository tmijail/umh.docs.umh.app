In this chapter, you will learn how to monitor, manage and configure your UMH
instance with the Management Console.

At this stage, you should have already installed the UMH on your device. If you
have not done so, please follow the steps in the [Installation](/docs/getstarted/installation)
chapter first.

## A Few Words About the Communication

Now that you have connected a UMH instance to the Management Console, you might
be curious about how the Management Console communicates with the instance.

The Management Companion, serving as an agent within each UMH instance, provides
a secure link to the Management Console. It enables comprehensive and secure
monitoring and management of the UMH, ensuring system health and streamlined
configuration, all while acting as a vigilant watchdog over system components and
connected devices.

The diagram below illustrates the communication flow between the Management
Console and the instance:

For more information, visit the [architecture](/docs/architecture/)

## Overview of Your Instances

![Instance overview](/images/getstarted/managingTheSystem/instanceOverview.png?width=80%)

On the left side of the Management Console, you can view the list of your
instances. If you have just installed the UMH, you should see only one instance
in the list.

The status of your instance is indicated by color: green means everything is
working properly, while yellow indicates that there may be a connection issue.

The **Messages Received** statistic shows the number of messages received by you
from the instance since you opened the Management Console. It is usually a good
indicator of the health of the connection to the Companion.
If the number is not increasing for 10 seconds, the instance is considered
disconnected.

## Monitoring the Instance's Status

From the instance dashboard, in the overview tab, you can view the status of
your instance. There are multiple interfaces that display the status of each
component of the system.

### Modules

A _Module_ refers to a group of workloads in the United Manufacturing Hub
responsible for specific tasks. For example, the _Historian & Analytics_ module
represents the microservices, storage, and connections that are responsible for
storing and analyzing data.

In the **Modules** tab, you can view the status of each module. If a module is
not healthy, it means that one or more of its components are not functioning
properly.

### System

In the **System** tab, you can view the resource usage of your device, as well
as some system's information.

If there is an overload on the device, you can view it here. An overloaded device
is unable to handle the workload, and you should consider upgrading the device.

### Data

In the **Data** tab, you can see an overview of the data infrastructure, including
the number of messages going through the message broker, those stored in the
database, and messages received by each data source.

### Connection

In the **Connection** tab, you can view the status of all the data source connections
configured in the system. A non-healthy connection indicates that the device and
the data source are unable to communicate.

### Kubernetes

In the **Kubernetes** tab, you can check for any error events in the Kubernetes
cluster. Any errors suggest that the cluster is not operating correctly.

Additionally, this tab displays the version of the United Manufacturing Hub and
the Management Companion currently installed on your device.

## Manage the Instance

Before you begin, ensure that you are connected to the same network as the instance
for accessing the various services and features discussed below.

While a graphical user interface for managing the instance is not yet available,
you can still manage it via the command line.

### Access the Command Line

Access your device's shell either directly or via SSH. Note: Root user access is required for the following commands.

{{% notice tip %}}
In UMH's current version, add `--kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` to each kubectl command. Root privileges are needed to access it. The installation path of kubectl might vary (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/kubectl` on RHEL/Linux, `/opt/bin/kubectl` on flatcar). These paths may not be in the root user's PATH, so the commands below might appear complex.
{{% /notice %}}

### Interact with the Instance

First, set this environment variable:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

{{% notice note %}}
You can bypass this by adding --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml to your commands. All instructions in this chapter will include this flag.
{{% /notice %}}

Then, to get a list of pods, run:

<!-- This command is tested within #1153 -->
```bash
sudo $(which kubectl) get pods -n united-manufacturing-hub  --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

For a comprehensive list of commands, refer to the
[Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands).

{{% notice note %}}
Always specify the namespace when running a command by adding `-n united-manufacturing-hub`.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Access Node-RED

Node-RED is used in UMH for creating data flows. Access it via:

```text
http://<instance-ip-address>:1880/nodered
```

#### Access Grafana

UMH uses Grafana for dashboard displays. Get your credentials:
<!-- These two commands are tested within #1153 -->
```bash
sudo $(which kubectl) get secret grafana-secret --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub -o jsonpath="{.data.adminuser}" | base64 --decode; echo
sudo $(which kubectl) get secret grafana-secret --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub -o jsonpath="{.data.adminpassword}" | base64 --decode; echo
```

Then, access Grafana here:

```text
http://<instance-ip-address>:8080
```

Use the retrieved credentials to log in.

#### Access the RedPanda Console

Manage the Kafka broker via the RedPanda Console:

```text
http://<instance-ip-address>:8090
```

#### Interact with the Database

UMH uses TimescaleDB. Open a psql session:

<!-- This command is tested within #1153 -->
```bash
sudo $(which kubectl) exec -it $(sudo $(which kubectl) get pods --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub -l app.kubernetes.io/component=timescaledb -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub -- psql -U postgres
```

Run SQL queries as needed. For an overview of the database schema, refer to the
[Data Model](/docs/architecture/datamodel/database) documentation.

#### Connect MQTT to MQTT Explorer

Use MQTT Explorer for a structured overview of MQTT topics. Connect using the instance's IP and port 1883.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `You must be logged in to the server` while using the `kubectl` Command

If you encounter the error below while using the `kubectl` command:

```text
E1121 13:05:52.772843  218533 memcache.go:265] couldn't get current server API group list: the server has asked for the client to provide credentials
error: You must be logged in to the server (the server has asked for the client to provide credentials)
```

This issue can be resolved by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable. Run
the following command:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

Alternatively, use the `--kubeconfig` flag to specify the configuration file path:

```bash
sudo $(which kubectl) --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml get pods -n united-manufacturing-hub
```

### "Permission Denied" Error with `kubectl` Command

Encountering the error below while using the `kubectl` command:

```text
error: error loading config file "/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml": open /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml: permission denied
```

Indicates the need for root access. Run the command with `sudo`, or log in as
the root user.

### `kubectl: command not found` error

If you encounter the error below while using the `kubectl` command:

```text
kubectl: command not found
```

The solution is to use the full path to the `kubectl` binary. You can do this by
prefixing the command with `/usr/local/bin/` (for RHEL and other Linux systems), or `/opt/bin/` (for flatcar) or by adding it to your `PATH`
environment variable:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/kubectl get pods -n united-manufacturing-hub

# or

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

### Viewing Pod Logs for Troubleshooting

Logs are essential for diagnosing and understanding the behavior of your applications and infrastructure. Here's how to view logs for key components:

- **Management Companion Logs**: To view the real-time logs of the Management Companion, use the following command. This can be helpful for monitoring the Companion's activities or troubleshooting issues.

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) logs -f mgmtcompanion-0 -n mgmtcompanion --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```

- **TimescaleDB Logs**: For real-time logging of the TimescaleDB, execute this command. It's useful for tracking database operations and identifying potential issues.

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) logs -f united-manufacturing-hub-timescaledb-0 -n united-manufacturing-hub --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```

### Restarting a Pod for Troubleshooting

Sometimes, the most straightforward troubleshooting method is to restart a problematic pod. Hereâ€™s how to restart specific pods:

- **Restart Management Companion**: If you encounter issues with the Management Companion, restart it with this command:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) delete pod mgmtcompanion-0 -n mgmtcompanion --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```

- **Restart TimescaleDB**: Should TimescaleDB exhibit unexpected behavior, use the following command to restart it:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) delete pod united-manufacturing-hub-timescaledb-0 -n united-manufacturing-hub --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```

### Troubleshooting Redpanda / Kafka

For insights into your Kafka streams managed by Redpanda, these commands are invaluable:

- **List All Topics**: To get an overview of all topics in your Redpanda cluster:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) exec -it --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub  united-manufacturing-hub-kafka-0 -- rpk topic list
  ```

- **Describe a Specific Topic**: For detailed information about a specific topic, such as `umh.v1.e2e-enterprise.aachen.packaging`, use:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) exec -it --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub united-manufacturing-hub-kafka-0 -- rpk topic describe umh.v1.e2e-enterprise.aachen.packaging
  ```

- **Consume Messages from a Topic**: To view messages from a topic like `umh.v1.e2e-enterprise.aachen.packaging`, this command is useful for real-time data observation:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) exec -it --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub united-manufacturing-hub-kafka-0 -- rpk topic consume umh.v1.e2e-enterprise.aachen.packaging
  ```
