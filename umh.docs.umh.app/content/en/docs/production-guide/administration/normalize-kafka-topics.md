<!-- overview -->

Kafka excels at processing a high volume of messages but can encounter difficulties
with excessive topics, which may lead to insufficient memory. The optimal Kafka
setup involves minimal topics, utilizing the
[event key](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_concepts_and_terms) for logical
data segregation.

On the contrary, MQTT shines when handling a large number of topics with a small
number of messages. But when bridging MQTT to Kafka, the number of topics can
become overwhelming.
Specifically, with the default configuration, Kafka is able to handle around
100-150 topics. This is because there is a limit of 1000 partitions per broker,
and each topic requires has 6 partitions by default.

So, if you are experiencing memory issues with Kafka, you may want to consider
combining multiple topics into a single topic with different keys. The diagram
below illustrates how this principle simplifies topic management.

{{< notice note >}}
There are two configurations for the topic merge point: one in the Companion
configuration for Benthos data sources and another in the Helm chart for data bridges.

<!-- steps -->

## Data Sources

To adjust the topic merge point for data sources, modify
{{< resource type="configmap" name="management-companion" >}} configmap. This
can be easily done with the following command:

```bash
sudo $(which kubectl) edit configmap {{< resource type="configmap" name="management-companion" >}} -n {{< resource type="ns" name="management-companion" >}} --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

This command opens the current configuration in the default editor, allowing you
to set the `umh_merge_point` to your preferred value:

```yaml
data:
  umh_merge_point: <numeric-value>
```

Ensure the value is at least 3 and update the `lastUpdated` field to the current
Unix timestamp to trigger the automatic refresh of existing data sources.

## Data Bridge

For data bridges, the merge point is defined individually in the Helm chart values
for each bridge. Update the Helm chart installation with the new `topicMergePoint`
value for each bridge. See the [Helm chart documentation](/docs/reference/helm-chart/#bridges)
for more details.

Setting the `topicMergePoint` to -1 disables the merge feature.
