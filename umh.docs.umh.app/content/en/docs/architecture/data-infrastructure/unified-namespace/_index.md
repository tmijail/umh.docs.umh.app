  Discover the Unified Namespace's role as a central hub for shop floor data in
  UMH.

The Unified Namespace (UNS) within the United Manufacturing Hub is a vital module
facilitating the streamlined flow and management of data. It comprises various
microservices:

- [data-bridge](/docs/architecture/data-infrastructure/unified-namespace/data-bridge):
  Bridges data between MQTT and Kafka and between multiple Kafka instances, ensuring
  efficient data transmission.
- [HiveMQ](/docs/architecture/data-infrastructure/unified-namespace/mqtt-broker):
  An MQTT broker crucial for receiving data from IoT devices on the shop floor.
- [Redpanda (Kafka)](/docs/architecture/data-infrastructure/unified-namespace/kafka-broker):
  Manages large-scale data processing and orchestrates communication between microservices.
- [Redpanda Console](/docs/architecture/data-infrastructure/unified-namespace/kafka-console):
  Offers a graphical interface for monitoring Kafka topics and messages.

The UNS serves as a pivotal point in the UMH architecture, ensuring data from shop
floor systems and sensors (gathered via the Data Connectivity module) is effectively
processed and relayed to the Historian and external Data Warehouses/Data Lakes
for storage and analysis.
