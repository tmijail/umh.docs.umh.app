This section provides a comprehensive overview of the legacy microservices within
the United Manufacturing Hub. These microservices are currently in a transitional
phase, being maintained and deployed alongside newer versions of UMH as we gradually
shift from Data Model v1 to v2. While these legacy components are set to be deprecated
in the future, they continue to play a crucial role in ensuring smooth operations
and compatibility during this transition period.
