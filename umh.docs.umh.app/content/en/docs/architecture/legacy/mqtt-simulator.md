The IoTSensors MQTT Simulator is a microservice that simulates sensors sending data to the
MQTT broker. You can read the full documentation on the

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/amine-amaach/simulators/tree/main/ioTSensorsMQTT).

<!-- body -->

## {{% heading "howitworks" %}}

The microservice publishes messages on the topic `ia/raw/development/ioTSensors/`,
creating a subtopic for each simulation. The subtopics are the names of the
simulations, which are `Temperature`, `Humidity`, and `Pressure`.
The values are calculated using a normal distribution with a mean and standard
deviation that can be configured.
