The Management Console simplifies the deployment of the
[Data Infrastructure](/docs/architecture/data-infrastructure/) on any existing
system, and also guides you through the provisioning of the
[Device & Container Infrastructure](/docs/architecture/device--container-infrastructure/).

## When should I use it?

Utilize the Management Console for initial deployment of the United
Manufacturing Hub. It supports provisioning on both centralized servers and
edge devices, offering flexibility in deployment options.

## What can I do with it?

Provision the United Manufacturing Hub on any existing system, and link it to
the Management Console. The Management Console will then be able to manage the
system and its resources.

## How can I use it?

To start, add a new instance in the Management Console. The Console provides a
command that you execute on your target system, automating the installation of
the United Manufacturing Hub. For detailed system requirements and
compatibility, consult the [Installation](/docs/getstarted/installation/) guide.

## What are the limitations?

Current limitations include the necessity for pre-configured systems for
installation and linking to the Management Console. As of now, the Console
doesn't support provisioning new systems directly.

## Where to get more information?
