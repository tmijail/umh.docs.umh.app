## When should I use it?
There are multiple ways to provision the United Manufacturing Hub.


## What can I do with it?
The Management Console lets you deploy the [Data Infrastructure](https://www.umh.app/umh-integrated-platform-data-infrastructure) on any existing system, and also guides you through the provisioning of the [Device & Container Infrastructure](https://www.umh.app/umh-integrated-platform-device-container-infrastructure).

## How can I use it?
After logging in to the Management Console, you can click on the **+ ADD INSTANCE** button in the top right corner. This will open a dialog where you can choose between the different provisioning options.
