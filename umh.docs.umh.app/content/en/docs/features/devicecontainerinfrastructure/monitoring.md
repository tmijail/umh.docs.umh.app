The Management Console supports you to monitor and manage the Data Infrastructure
and the Device & Container Infrastructure.

## When should I use it?

Once initial deployment of the United Manufacturing Hub is completed, you can
monitor and manage it using the Management Console. If you have not deployed yet,
navigate to the [Get Started!](/docs/getstarted/installation/) guide.

## What can I do with it?

You can monitor the statuses of the following items using the Management Console:

- **Modules**: A Module refer to a grouped set of related Kubernetes components
  like pods, statefulsets, and services. It provides a way to monitor and manage
  these components as a single unit.
- **System**:
  - Resource Utilization: CPU, RAM, and DISK usages.
  - OS information: the used operating system, kernel version, and instruction
    set architecture.
- **Datastream**: the rate of Kafka/TimescaleDB messages per second, the health of both connections and data sources.
- **Kubernetes**: the number of error events and the deployed management
  companion's and UMH's versions.

In addtion, you can check the topic structure used by data sources and the
corresponding payloads.

Moreover, you can create a new connection and initilize the created connection to
deploy a data source.

## How can I use it?

After logging in, the Instance Dashboard page shows the **Overview** tab.
You can click and open each status on this tab.

The **Connection Management** tab shows the status of all the instance's connections and their associated
data sources. Moreover, you can create a new connection, as well as initialize them.
Read more about the Connection Management in the [Connectivity](/docs/features/connectivity/) section.

The Data Dashboard displays the topic structure and publisher & subscriber
information.

## What are the limitations?

Presently, removing a UMH instance from the Management Console is not supported.
After overwriting an instance, the old one will display an offline status.

## Where to get more information?

- The [Get Started!](/docs/getstarted/installation/) guide assists you to set up
  the United Manufacturing Hub.
