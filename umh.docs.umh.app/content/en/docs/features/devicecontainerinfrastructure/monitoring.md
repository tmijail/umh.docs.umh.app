The Management Console supports you to monitor and manage the Data Infrastructure 
and the Device & Container Infrastructure.

## When should I use it?

Once initial deployment of the United Manufacturing Hub is completed, you can 
monitor and manage it using the Management Console. If you have not deployed yet, 
navigate to the [Get Started!](/docs/getstarted/installation/) guide.


## What can I do with it?

You can monitor the statuses of the following items using the Management Console:
- **Modules**: A Module refer to a grouped set of related Kubernetes components 
like pods, statefulsets, and services. It provides a way to monitor and manage 
these components as a single unit.
- **System**:
    - Resource Utilization: CPU, RAM, and DISK usages.
    - OS information: the used operating system, kernel version, and instruction 
    set architecture.
- **Data source**: the rate of Kafka/TimescaleDB messages per second, the health 
of data sources.
- **Data connection**: the health of connections. It checks the latency between 
the UMH instance and the corresponding data source, for example, an OPC-UA server.
- **Kubernetes**: the number of error events and the deployed management 
companion's and UMH's versions.

In addtion, you can check the topic structure used by data sources and the 
corresponding payloads.

Moreover, you can create a new connection and initilize the created connection to 
deploy a data source.

## How can I use it?

After logging in, the Instance Dashboard page shows the **Overview** tab. 
You can click and open each status on this tab.

The **Data Connections** tab shows the status of connections. Moreover, you can 
add new connections on this tab.

You can initialize created connections on the **Data Sources** tab. Additionaly, 
you can check the health of connection and data sources.

The Data Dashboard displays the topic structure and publisher & subscriber 
information.

## What are the limitations?
Presently, removing a UMH instance from the Management Console is not supported. 
After overwriting an instance, the old one will display an offline status.
